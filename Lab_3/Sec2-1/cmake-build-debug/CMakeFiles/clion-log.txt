CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib64/cmake/protobuf/protobuf-options.cmake:6 (option):
  Policy CMP0077 is not set: option() honors normal variables.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0077" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, option is clearing the
  normal variable 'protobuf_MODULE_COMPATIBLE'.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/lib64/cmake/protobuf/protobuf-config.cmake:2 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:103 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
